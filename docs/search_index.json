In this guide, you will find individual lessons on specific aspects of data management. These are geared towards active data management, meaning projects that are in process. These data are being updated, collected, aggregated, processed, cleaned, or analyzed on a regular basis. In other words, the focus of this material is how to integrate solid data management practices into your work without requiring a complete retooling of existing workflows and processes. This guide has been published through bookdown via GitHub. [Publication date of the guide, citation, w/e] This guide has been written by two librarians who are also active researchers. Each author has joined existing projects and launched new ones. We have pulled on best practices from our education and lived experiences. 1.2 How to use this resource While the content of each lesson varies, you will generally learn definitions, recommended practices, and tips for integrating said practices into new and existing workflows. Each lesson is designed to be a standalone object for point of need adoption. In other words, when you realize you need more information about annotating code, creating a README, or keeping your data safe, you can jump right to that lesson. The lessons are ordered roughly according to a typical research lifecycle, but it is not necessary to complete prior lessons in order to understand and apply what you need. This guide should be considered a starting point: the general recommendations may not be specific enough for your needs. In each lesson, we have provided additional resources and links to other portions of the guide. However, there are many resources available online and likely at your institution to provide the support you may need – we suggest looking into whether your institution’s library has support for research data management, or reaching out to your institutional office of research. All resources are only as valuable as they are to you. While we have captured and distilled recommended practices in this guide, consider which of these are useful or not in your research.

Presented as a lifecycle, as data and publications can be reused by other researchers in the design of additional projects. Research Data Management: The processes, tools, and techniques necessary for collecting, analysing, storing, and publishing data. Temporal Gaps: Periods of time between research activities. 2.3 The Lesson All research projects follow a general lifecycle: from planning and design, through to implementation (which includes data collection and analysis), and concluding with concluding with output sharing (including research publishing and data depositing) and reuse, where the cycle begins again, with a new iteration of the same project or the development and launch of a new investigation. \\[add in lifecycle image from Harvard\\] Cioffi, M., Goldman, J., &amp; Marchese, S. (2023). Harvard Biomedical Research Data Lifecycle (Version 5). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8076168 While the lifecycle image invokes a tidy overview of how research projects generally progress, the reality is often more complex. For example, a project may require iterations of design and data collection before moving to analysis and publication. This can be compounded by changes in disciplinary research practices and policies at institutional, state, and federal levels. This messy reality of research projects means that there can be temporal gaps in research; in other words, for various reasons, projects may start and stop over time. These temporal gaps can be most acutely felt as personnel join and depart projects. Robust data management practices can be invaluable for closing those gaps and easing team members’ transitions in and out of a research project. In the remainder of this guide, you’ll learn more about different aspects of research data management that will make it easier for you to get acclimated to your lab’s research data, as well as prepare it for your eventual departure from the lab/project (which in turn will make it easier for the next research collaborator!). \\[add in a mechanism to encourage students to click the next one, like a table of contents or sentence based links to the rest of the content\\] 2.4 Further reading Research lifecycle guide (Princeton) Research Data Management Workbook Data Management and Sharing Activities (ARL) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
